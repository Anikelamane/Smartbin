# Smartbin
# A product to upgrade the daily life and segregation of wastes


Trash bins play vital role in creating a hygienic environment and a clean surrounding. But they are the most misused and misunderstood thing now. Even being educated people doesnâ€™t show their interest in separating dry and wet waste. These small things are very vital in creating a clean and hygienic environment. Because the dry wastes can be recycled and wet wastes can be used as manures and organic fertilizers.

The mixture of these wastes causes many hygienic issues and are fatal to the ecosystem. Animals smell the organic or food wastes and eat them with other wastes like plastic covers aluminium foil etc. This cause different diseases and finally leads to the death of those animals. Now it is our responsibility to ensure safety ,sanity and separation of the wastes.
Therefore it is a basic need now and again we have to go for a technology as a solution.

I discussed these issues with local people, some environmentalists like Mr. Akhilesh Chipli , some organic manure manufacturers like Green Planet , some farmers.
Through this repeated discussions we got some more knowledge about our problem and also some suggestions for the model also some real time problems in creating a solution.
With our knowledge and idea we got the support of Our community on getting sufficient technological knowledge. We ourselves found some useful sensors and technology which would help in creating a realtime workable solution, that is SmartBin
